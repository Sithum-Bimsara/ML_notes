    "# 📊 Understanding Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 What is Data?\n",
    "Data are raw facts that have not been processed to explain their meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Types of Data\n",
    "There are three main types of data:\n",
    "1. **📑 Structured Data**\n",
    "2. **📂 Unstructured Data**\n",
    "3. **📃 Semi-structured Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Structured Data 📑\n",
    "Structured data is organized and stored in a well-defined format, often using relational databases. It follows a pre-defined data model and is easy to search, retrieve, and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Characteristics of Structured Data:\n",
    "- Stored in a **tabular format** (rows and columns).\n",
    "- Clearly defined and organized.\n",
    "- Data is stored in **SQL databases or Excel files**.\n",
    "- **Rows and columns** are related to each other, providing a proper view and understanding of the data.\n",
    "- **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)** are used to manage structured data.\n",
    "- Structured data is stored in **relational databases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 What is Tabular Format?\n",
    "Tabular format refers to the organization of data in rows and columns, where:\n",
    "- **📌 Rows** represent individual records.\n",
    "- **📌 Columns** define the attributes of the records.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Unstructured Data 📂\n",
    "Unstructured data does not have a predefined format or model. It is irregular, ambiguous, and harder to analyze compared to structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Characteristics of Unstructured Data:\n",
    "- ❌ No predefined structure.\n",
    "- ❌ No data model.\n",
    "- ❌ Data is irregular and ambiguous.\n",
    "- ✅ Easiest to extract data from.\n",
    "- 🔹 **80% - 90%** of data is unstructured.\n",
    "- 🔹 Includes **text, numbers, audio, video, images, messages, social media posts**.\n",
    "- 📌 Examples: **Facebook, Instagram, YouTube**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Example: Surveys\n",
    "Survey data can be unstructured. For instance:\n",
    "- Some survey questions require multiple-choice answers.\n",
    "- Others require open-ended responses (e.g., *\"How does coffee make you feel? Please elaborate.\"*). This is unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Challenges of Unstructured Data:\n",
    "- **🛠 Complex to analyze** compared to structured data.\n",
    "- Previously, only structured data was extensively used.\n",
    "- However, with the help of **🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, unstructured data is now widely utilized.\n",
    "- 📌 Example: **Face recognition technology used by Google** relies on unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗄 Storage of Unstructured Data:\n",
    "Unstructured data is often stored in a **data lake**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💾 What is a Data Lake?\n",
    "A data lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed. Unlike structured data storage systems like relational databases, a data lake can handle **unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Semi-structured Data 📃\n",
    "Semi-structured data falls between structured and unstructured data. It has elements of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Characteristics of Semi-structured Data:\n",
    "- It is a combination of structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "- Some organization exists, but it does not fit rigidly into a tabular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Examples of Semi-structured Data:\n",
    "- 📧 **Emails** (contains structured metadata like sender and timestamp, but unstructured content in the body).\n",
    "- 📜 **XML files**.\n",
    "- 🌐 **World Wide Web (WWW)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is XML?\n",
    "XML (**eXtensible Markup Language**) is a markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both **human-readable and machine-readable**. It is used to structure data in a way that can be easily shared across different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Conclusion\n",
    "Understanding the different types of data is essential for **data management and analysis**. With advancements in **AI and big data technologies**, both structured and unstructured data are becoming increasingly valuable for decision-making and insights generation. 🚀\n",
